# Glowy Triangle (Actually a square)

Inspired by http://www.misc.name/triangle-attractor/
And https://www.shadertoy.com

This was originally intended to be a raspberry pi project, but the raspberry pi I brought with me on holiday broke the SD card reader.

I was thoroghly prepared with many backups, including a couple AVRs.

In the end, I am using a 5V/16Mhz Trinket, a small grid I 3D printed, and an LED grid.

LED grid I used: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OM0UTS2
